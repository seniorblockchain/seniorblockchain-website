<p class="indent-4">
Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) offers a radically different paradigm of storing and managing information online. Decentralised ledgers lack the points of failure and associated security issues of traditional databases and top-down protocols, whilst at the same time posing their own unique challenges for effective deployment and maintenance.
</p>
<p class="indent-4">
The advantages in terms of costs, transparency, immutability, security and confidence that are characteristic of blockchain solutions mean that financial businesses, government departments and other organisations are exploring applications of all kinds with a view to delivering services more profitably and efficiently. However, reliable deployment of a new blockchain fit for purpose entails extensive overheads in terms of network infrastructure, development, security and ongoing maintenance. Moreover, use of an existing blockchain (such as Bitcoin) comes with numerous problems for a mainstream business, not least because users have no control over blockchain features or future development.
</p>
<p class="indent-4">
An attractive model for blockchain service provision exists in cloud computing. Cloud services may be tailored according to the needs of the organisation and infrastructure, platforms and software provided as services via web interfaces - without businesses having to take on the maintenance of these themselves.
</p>
<p class="indent-4">
Senior Blockchain will take a similar approach to blockchain deployment, enabling organisations to provision their own private blockchains, senior blockchain is responsible for its protection and management, and if possible, the blockchain project will create them virtually in the world of Metaverse. This approach means there are few unnecessary overheads whilst allowing businesses to secure the benefits of a blockchain-based solution, developing services via powerful APIs and lite web-based clients.
